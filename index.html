	<!-- 	A programmer joke: "IN A PROGRAMMERS "HEAD"":
			style BOTH does and doesn't "deal" with classes
			as a class creates a child from a father
			when i go to class i absorb information
			An id creates a unique "identity" 
			therefore -> "my identity in class is unique"
			doesnt describe the distinguishment wholly,
			but rather presents the styling problem
			in it of itself.... myStyle is a joke then.-->
	
	<!-- My style therefore would be opensource and blue because im awesome and cool
		Because I'm about to picture code in my mind.-->
		<style>
		    .myStyle{
			background: #000;
			border: 1px solid #0000FF;
			padding: 10px;
			color: #fff;
			width: 100px;
		    }
		</style>
		<!-- More joke: is my style of being a programmer really so blue? 
			do i need padding to make me feel better about myself,
			do people need a background color to describe "me."  Am I "unique????? "
			How many pixels does someone's monitor need to describe me in code..etc.--->

		<h2>Content Goes Here</h2>
		<p>We really need more content to demonstrate how to style things.  So type something, it really doesn't matter what.</p>

		<h2>Code Examples</h2>
		<p>
			<!-- More joke: The pre tag allows the text within the tag
				to be rendered on the web page with consideration
				towards white space significance in the html code, and other "fixed" "stylings"....
					maybe..-->
			
			<!-- When dealing with the code block, applying "myStyle" CSS to the code block.
				wont necessarily work... Because thats not how the pre tag was styled to style....-->
			<pre>
				int main(){ 
					cout << Hello world; 
				};
			</pre>
			<!-- Demonstrates the significance of the white space using the construction of the pre block..
				Next to a <p> block -->
			<p> Let's go into the rabbit rain... </p>
			<pre>
				Hm. Seems "moistly" white rabbit...  Should probably put on some dry clothes...
			</pre>
			
						<div class="myStyle">
							Ahh.. much more dry and warmer.
						</div>
						<!-- whats closer to reality is that my style is a black box,
						with clear white text in it and a border of blue coolness
						therefore -> myStyle can be anything in my head :)  -->
